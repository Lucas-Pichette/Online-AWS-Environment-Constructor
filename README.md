# Online AWS Environment Constructor

## Purpose
There is currently a drought of tools for people to use that allow them to get a customized list of AWS resources for any project they wish to carry out. With cloud computing removing immense capital expenditures for variable expenses, more people and organizations are able to transform their ideas into a reality. AWS is the leading provider for cloud resources, providing over 167 AWS cloud resources, and continuing to develop new cloud resources. Knowing how to use the available cloud computing resources is complex and time consuming, and typically Solutions Architects are paid a hefty sum to provide a customized AWS environment for a project’s needs. However, the Online AWS Environment Constructor aims to provide a tool that describes the AWS resources needed for a particular project without having to spend any money.

## Functional Areas

### Landing Page

Serves to provide an introduction to the tool, show how the user interface looks, give an idea as to what the user experience is like, show the utility of the tool, and provide other information such as: how to contribute to the tool, how to raise an issue regarding the tool, how to propose a new feature/change to the tool, and other questions that may fall under the FAQ-section.

### Survey

This is where users will answer questions about their project so that we can determine viable solutions for them. This survey is dynamically rendered, not only to ensure they answer as few questions as possible, but also so that we get as much information as we need.

### Solutions

After the user has completed and submitted their survey they are redirected to the possible ‘solutions’ for their product/project. A solution would be an AWS architecture blueprint, showing them all of the AWS resources their environment would use, the total expected monthly cost, as well as more granular information about the resources themselves.
