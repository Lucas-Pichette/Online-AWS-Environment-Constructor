                        <p class="info-card-answer">The Online AWS Environment Constructor seeks to provide users with information that will enable them to make the best cloud computing decisions for their specific projects.</p>

                        <h3 class="info-card-question"> Who is this tool designed for?</h3>
                        <p class="info-card-answer">This web application is targeted towards people who think cloud computing could be the right choice for their product, but do not know where to start. An AWS Solutions Architect may still be required to achieve the user's goals,
                            but this tool could reduce the amount of consulting work that is required.</p>

                        <h3 class="info-card-question"> Does tool cost money?</h3>
                        <p class="info-card-answer">This tool is completely free to use, and no money is made from it. It's part passion-project, part resume-builder. The point of this tool is to make AWS resources more readily available to everyone, which would not be the case
                            if it cost money to use. </p>
